Now that I am nearing the end of my graduate school days, I will not have any excuse to not blog. I will start by writing about my personal experiences during
the job hunt. In the future, I hope to keep my writing muscles active by writing about new things I learn. Now back to writing my thesis and graduating in Spring
2024!
