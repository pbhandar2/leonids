	I am a PhD candidate in the Computer Science and Informatics program at Emory University graduating this spring (May, 2024). My thesis, "Optimizing Block Storage using Multi-tier Caches", focuses on measuring and analyzing the performance of storage systems, modeling performance using machine learning techniques, and developing novel techniques to improve the efficiency of workload analysis. I am advised by <a href="http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~avani/">Dr. Avani Wildani</a>. This is my <a href="https://moccasin-gertie-16.tiiny.site/">Resume</a>. I am actively applying to Software Engineer/Research Scientist roles. Feel free to reach out.
