- name: Multi-Tier Caching
  descr: "The availability of cache devices with diverse cost-performance profiles has improved the prospects of multi-tier caches. Workloads continue grow larger making DRAM-only caches not large enough to yield acceptable hit rates. Furthermore, multi-tier caches have been shown to improve cost-efficiency. We want to configure multi-tier caches based on device and workload properties while efficiently evaluating the large configuration space. We are also interested in optimizing multi-tier caches by using better cache admission policies."
