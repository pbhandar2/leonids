- name: Multi-Tier Caching
  descr: "The availability of cache devices with diverse cost-performance profiles has improved the prospects of multi-tier caches. Workload sizes continue to grow making DRAM-only caches not large enough to yield acceptable hit rates. Furthermore, multi-tier caches have been shown to improve cost-efficiency. We want to configure multi-tier caches based on device and workload properties while efficiently evaluating the large configuration space. We are also interested in optimizing multi-tier caches by using better cache admission policies."
- name: Sampling for Block Storage Traces
  descr: "Random spatial sampling is used to reduce overhead for trace collection and analysis. We extend random spatial sampling to work with multiblock storage requests where it is aware of features like mean read/write request size, mean read/write interarrival time, and write ratio."
