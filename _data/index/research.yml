- name: Filesystem Cache Tuning
  descr: "Filesystems have default cache parameter but the general parameters are not optimal for all workloads. We analyze application I/O pattern in order to tune the cache configurations of a filesystem. We use traces from applications running on IBM GPFS to tune pagepool parameters. Pagepool is the GPFS page cache. It does not use the Linux page cache. Our goal is to develop a tool that can make filesystem cache recommendation based on periodic sampling of the workload."

- name: Multi-Tier Caching
  descr: "With the availability of multiple devices for caching, multi-tier solutions have more potential than ever. For a given workload, there can be various configurations that would be ideal depending on the performance and cost constraints. Our goal is to develop a framework for workload characterization of multi-tier caching workloads in order to design workload aware multi-tier cache systems."
