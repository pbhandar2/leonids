- name: I/O Workload Classification using CNN
  descr: We convert block I/O into access pattern images. We classify these images based on the labels which is determined by the source of the data. We show that workload labels can mean different things depending on the dataset. We analyze images from the CNN layers in order to analyze the features being used for classification.

- name: PyMimircache
  descr: "PyMimircache is an open source cache simulation framework developed by Junchen Yang as part of the Emory SimBioSys Lab. I implemented miniature-simulations of a workload based on paper in FAST'15: Efficient MRC Construction with SHARDS by Carl A. Waldspurger, Nohhyun Park, Alexander Garthwaite, and Irfan Ahmad, CloudPhysics, Inc."

- name: Using Smart Agents to Improve Connectivity in a Segmented Multi-Radio Wireless Network using SDNs
  descr: "The issue of scalability is one of the biggest problems in the area of wireless mesh networking hindering its wide adoption despite the obvious benefits. Being an inexpensive approach compared to other network model, wireless mesh network is a perfect tool to connect underprivileged areas to the global network. We introduce a new component in our network model called the smart agent which has a birdâ€™s eye view of the network and we use this information to implement policies that influence the connection of the second interface of multi-radio nodes."
